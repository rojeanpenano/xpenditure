### **1. Key Features of XPENDITURE**
#### From Chapter 1: Project Context, Purpose, and Features
**Planned Features:**
- **Income and Expense Tracking** (Completed):
  - Users can record transactions (income/expense) via API.
  - Transactions are categorized and associated with a user.

- **Shared Expenses** (Pending):
  - Features to split expenses among multiple users need implementation.
  
- **Personalized Budgeting** (Partially Implemented):
  - Transaction storage allows for budgeting logic in the future.

- **Data Privacy** (Completed):
  - Local MongoDB storage is implemented; no cloud integration ensures data remains private.

- **Offline Functionality** (Framework Ready):
  - Backend design supports local storage, paving the way for offline-first features.

- **Export to Excel** (Pending):
  - No feature to export data yet.

### **2. Implemented Features in the Backend**
- **Backend Setup**:
  - Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB are fully configured.
  - Environment variables used for secure MongoDB connection.

- **Endpoints**:
  - User registration and login.
  - Add and retrieve transactions.

- **Validation**:
  - Ensures valid user input for `userId`, `amount`, `type`, etc.

- **Testing**:
  - All implemented endpoints were tested via Postman.

- **Documentation**:
  - README is completed and uploaded to GitHub.

### **3. Next Steps**
1. **Shared Expenses**:
   - Implement logic to split and track shared costs among users.
   - Add fields in the `Transaction` schema to accommodate group splits (e.g., `sharedWith` array).

2. **Budget Tracking**:
   - Design APIs for users to set and monitor budgets.
   - Use algorithms (e.g., dynamic programming or greedy techniques) to calculate budget optimization.

3. **Export to Excel**:
   - Add an endpoint to generate downloadable Excel reports for transactions.

4. **Visual Features**:
   - Implement APIs for generating data visualizations (e.g., cash flow charts).
   - Consider libraries like Chart.js for the frontend.

5. **Offline Functionality**:
   - Explore options to sync MongoDB changes for offline-first use cases.

6. **Future AI Integration**:
   - Implement algorithms for financial insights (divide-and-conquer or dynamic programming for predictions).
